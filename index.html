                <p class="text-about-me">Hello, my name is Eduardo. I was born in November 2000, in Brazil, more accurately in Aracaju, city who is the capital of Sergipe state.</p>
                <p class="text-about-me">I recently concluded undergraduated course in Informational Systems, on Tiradentes University. During this undergraduated period, I had opportunities to internship in 2 places.</p>
                <p class="text-about-me">The first one was the Public Defensory of Sergipe, for 7 months, where I did activities of support in I.T. to the others colaborators. A great opportunity to practice the comunicattion and the colletive..</p>
                <p class="text-about-me">The second one was in the holding that owns the university where I studied. I worked doing Data Analysis, using resources such as SQL databases, Python language and libraries, PowerBI for data visualization, etc. I also had tasks more related to Data Engineering, having worked preparing environments and technologies for day-to-day use. To do this, I worked with Google Cloud Platform (we were migrating the services to cloud services), Terraform, Docker, Python, Gitlab CI/CD etc.</p>
                <p class="text-about-me">Now I'm getting interested and learning about web development, as well as continuing to learn about the data area.</p>
